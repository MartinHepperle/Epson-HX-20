Some crude disassembly of some System ROMs.

The first Basic ROM, mapped into the memory range C000-DFFF, appears in two versions V1.0 and V1.1.
These versions differ, but here is no difference between the Japanese/US/UK systems and the European systems.

The second BASIC ROM, covering the range E000-FFFF, also exists in both versions V1.0 and V1.1 but these
also differ for the Japanese/US/UK and the European systems.
