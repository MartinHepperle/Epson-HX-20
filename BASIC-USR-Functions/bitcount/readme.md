This is a simple USR function .
It demonstrates <br>
* passing the integer variable from BASIC and returning the integer result,
* * embedding mutliple USR function in a single machine language module.
  * 

The assembler module contains two USR functions:
The first counts the bits in a 16-bit integer, the second rotates the the bits in a 16-bit integer left by 1.
