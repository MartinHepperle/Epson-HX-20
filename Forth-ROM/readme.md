This is an augmented disassembly of the HCCS Forth ROM for the Epson HX-20.

I had created it from the ROM image and added the options to assemble versions for the different system ROMs of the HX-20 (BASIC V1.0, 1.1, European, International/Japanese).
In this process I also removed some unused bytes and used the freed bytes to implement a few additional Forth words e.g. for accessing the RS232C interface.
